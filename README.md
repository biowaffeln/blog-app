A simple application for demonstrating how CRUD-Operations work in AngularFirebase. Repository for [this blog post](https://www.thecodecampus.de/blog/getting-started-firestore-angularfire2/).

You can check out a demo of the application [here](https://blog-app-bf875.firebaseapp.com/).

## setup

Run `npm i` to install the dependencies, then `npm start` to start a development server at `http://localhost:4200/`.
